# dorbs

**dorbs** (short for "adorable server") is a tiny, vibe-coded web server with strict limitations for security and performance:

- Serves **only** `.html`, `.css`, and `.webp` files
- Files are served **only** from the executable's folder, no subfolders

It's simple, potentially secure, and maybe even fast—but don't expect perfection just yet. Enjoy the vibes! ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
