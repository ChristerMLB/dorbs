# dorbs

**dorbs** (short for "adorable server") is a tiny web server with strict limitations added for for potential security and performance:

- Serves **only** `.html`, `.css`, and `.webp` files
- Files are served **only** from the executable's folder, no subfolders

Security and performance are very much just potential, though, since the whole thing's vibe coded ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

So, you know, don't use it.
